This is my personal repository for Java projects.

## Code:
- Available upon request (pli373775@gmail.com)

## Sparse List
- Implemented SparseIndxedList: An implementation of an IndexedList designed for cases where only a few positions have distinct values from the initial value.
- Wrote unit tests for IndexedList's functions and iterator
- Discussed which implementation(s) of IndexedList is most appropriate for a roster of students
  
## Sorts
- Implemented insertion sort with "minimizing swaps" optimization 
- Developed MeasuredIndexedList, a list that keeps track of list accesses and mutations
- Discussed sorting algorithm asymptotic complexities and debugged a flawed sorting algorithm experiment

## RPN calculator
- Implemented a stack-based RPN calculator application
- Discussed all possible cases that could result in an error condition

## Flawed Deque
- Wrote unit tests for a given implementation of Deque that contains several flaws
- Listed all flaws found and the unit tests that uncovered them
- Implemented move-to-front and transpose-sequential-search heuristics and tested whether they improved linear search time through benchmark experiments.

## AVL Tree
- Implemented AvlTreeMap, an implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree
- Wrote unit tests for AvlTreeMap's core operations and self-balancing operations
- Implemented TreapMap, an implementation of probabilistically-balanced binary search tree (min-heap)
- Used benchmark testing to compare BST, Self-balanding BST (AvlTreeMap), and Treap (TreapMap).

## Hash Tables
- Implemented ChainingHashMap and OpenAddressingHashMap, two hash map implementations
- Used benchmark testing to compare performance of ChainingHashMap and OpenAddressingHashMap

## Graph
- Implemented SparseGraph, a Graph implementation using incidence lists for sparse graphs where most nodes aren't connected
- Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted shortest paths
- Tested SparseGraph implementation on a street graph program
